# Once Upon a Heartbreak
#
# I used to imagine myself as the main character, the shy girl who catches the eye of the tall, dark, and handsome guy. But yeah, maybe my imagination was a bit much.
#
# Then, he happened. It's a blur now, like a cheesy Netflix rom-com. He wasn't Prince Charming, but his smile could melt glaciers. It was like the universe said, "Here's your guy," and who was I to argue? We clicked instantly. Late-night chats, sharing secrets, the kind of intimacy that makes your soul feel seen. He had this energy that pulled me out of my shell. I gave him a safe space to be himself.
#
# Months flew by, and suddenly, we were building castles in the clouds, whispering about a future that felt so real.  No more fictional crushes. Just us, raw and real. Two years. Two incredible and perfect years of a love that felt invincible. We were the "it" couple. But then, life happened.
#
# College hit us hard. The pressure, the assignments, the doubts â€“ it all chipped away at us. Fights, unsaid words, and our love story ended with a sad look as we realized we were better off apart. The pain was awful. Every love song felt like a punch in the gut. But as the shock faded, I knew I wouldn't trade those two years for anything. The ache in my chest reminded me that I'd experienced something real, something precious. Losing him taught me love isn't a fairytale. It's messy and unpredictable, and sometimes it hurts. But it's also the most incredible feeling, a leap of faith worth taking.
#
# My love story with him wasn't perfect, but it burned bright. It reminded me that real love exists, not just in books or movies. Love might break your heart, but it also makes you see how beautiful and complicated life can be. I'm wiser now, more cautious, but still hopeful. Because even a moment of fireworks is better than a lifetime of darkness.
